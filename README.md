# Hey there! 👋 I'm Jayavarshini

🎓 Currently a 2nd year CSE student at SRM Kattankulathur  
🔬 Deeply curious about how data tells stories — from numbers to insights  
🧠 Learning to connect the dots between **code**, **creativity**, and **real-world problems**  

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Building Myself With:
- 🐍 Python — my comfort zone (and problem-solving partner)
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript — for bringing ideas to life on the web
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy — starting to unlock data magic
- 🧰 Git & GitHub — learning to track and showcase what I build
- 💻 VS Code + Jupyter Notebooks — where all my thoughts turn into code

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On:
- Building my **first portfolio website** (stay tuned 👀)
- Uploading mini Python + Web Dev projects — clean and simple
- Sharpening my basics for club recruitments & open-source stuff 🔍
- Practicing for the **IITM Data Science** qualifier (wish me luck 🍀)

---

## 💬 A Little About Me:
I'm someone who gets excited by clean UIs, satisfying code runs, and coffee-fueled bug fixes.  
I’m not here to be perfect — just **consistent, curious, and better than yesterday**.

---

## ✨ Random Facts:
- I like breaking down big concepts into tiny, understandable bits  
- Sometimes I fix bugs without knowing how 😅  
- I believe side projects teach more than 100 pages of notes  
- You’ll usually find me learning, tinkering, or organizing my Notion 💻✨
